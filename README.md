# The Competence Ontology
 
This is an operational ontology as a supplementary material to accompany the paper "Towards Ontology-based Competence Modeling in Enterprise Architecture" by Rodrigo F. Calhau, Carlos L. B. Azevedo and João Paulo A. Almeida.

It extends the [gUFO ontology](http://purl.org/nemo/doc/gufo) (A Lightweight Implementation of the Unified Foundational Ontology) by specializing gUFO classes with competence-related classes (PersonalCompetence, CompetenceType, etc.) as discussed in the paper.

The namespace for the ontology is <http://purl.org/nemo/competence>. It can be directly imported in Protégé.
